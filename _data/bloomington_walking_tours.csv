coll001,,0400.png,A Walk Through the Prospect Hill Historic District,,"City of Bloomington, Indiana",1840; 1860; 1900; 1906,"The neighborhood now known as Prospect Hill developed at the southwest corner of the original City Plat, which terminated at Third and Jackson Streets. Prospect Hill Addition was platted and annexed to the city on June 7, 1893. It was laid out on a rounded hill with South Rogers, Fairview, Third Street and Smith Avenue as its borders. The McPheeters Addition, which encompasses the eastern edge of the district, was platted and annexed in 1888. Later additions that moved west towards Walker Street were developed by J.D. and W.S. Showers. In the early days, from 1895 until 1910, the Southside Stone Company (later the Henly Stone Company) operated north of Second Street across from the hospital, which was established in an old brick farmhouse in 1905.

The Paris Dunning House, at the end of Third Street, anchors the neighborhood with its refined early Greek Revival and Federal style. It was the home of Prospect Hill’s most famous resident, Governor Paris Dunning. The brick house at 213 South Rogers is also thought to have been built around the same time, in the 1840-50s, and may be the oldest house in Bloomington. Another striking early property is the Gothic Revival farm house at 308 South Maple, built in 1860. The former home of Judge James Hughes, it was once called the “Prospect Property” and contained over 16 acres including the land that now forms blocks of housing on Fairview and Jackson Streets. A rural character remains in the neighborhood, with several small barns and an existing home adapted from a chicken house. Many of the smaller homes were built with decorative wooden porches that were later replaced with brick or limestone.

The Rogers Street neighborhood was developed as a prestigious upper middle class area bordered by workers’ cottages on the east, north, and later, west. It represents the only area developed as a professional residential neighborhood on the west side of town. The larger neighborhood was bordered on the west by the Monon Pond, once used as the city fairgrounds, the City graveyard (now Rose Hill Cemetery) and on the east by the levy. The levy famously housed Bloomington’s roistering saloons, houses of ill-repute and gambling venues.

The architecture of the Prospect Hill National Register District illustrates various “high styles” popular between 1890 and 1925, a time of growing affluence in Bloomington. Queen Anne, Free Classic and Period Revival style houses, some designed by prolific Bloomington architect John Nichols, are present. One small octagonal house on Rogers is a replica of Nichols’ studio, which was built and still stands on North College. Regionally important architects, Crapsey and Lamm, designed the home of Bloomington’s early druggist at 332 South Rogers. There are also several examples of vernacular style houses, two mid-nineteenth century houses with Greek Revival and Federal details, bungalows and American four-squares of the 1920s, including a splendid brick example of a Sears Catalogue home called “the Alhambra”.

This diverse group is a microcosm of Bloomington’s overall residential history. Several groceries, similar to the small brick storefront at 4th and Rogers, were once located throughout the neighborhood.

The Burns Grocery was one of eight stores in the city owned by Roy Burns. These tiny, full service and accessible venues were later replaced by the “supermarkets” of the 1950s.

By the 1960s the neighborhood had fallen into disrepair and the grandness of the houses along Rogers Street was lost in shabby siding and cobbled up rental units. Today that devastation is almost unimaginable. Prospect Hill’s story would be incomplete without including the efforts of Wilbert (Bill) Sturbaum, Rosemary Miller, the City of Bloomington, and Bloomington Restorations, Inc. (BRI) Between 1968 and 2005, Bill Sturbaum serially purchased and restored seven buildings in a single block. He saved four others by assuring their ownership to interested preservationists. Rosemary Miller championed the cause of the dilapidated Paris Dunning House in 1985, obtaining money for its restoration. The Prospect Hill Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in March 1991. Within the year, district residents were also successful in establishing Bloomington’ first locally designated historic district. Prospect Hill continues to prove its leadership in community planning issues, by adopting one of the first neighborhood plans in 2005. In 2008 the larger part of the neighborhood became Bloomington’s second Conservation District. New construction must follow guidelines established by the existing context. Several City grants have assisted in the restoration of scattered WPA limestone sidewalks that enhance the historic environment and make Prospect Hill such a notable place. More information on Prospect Hill and a copy of the National Register nomination is available in the Indiana Room of the Monroe County Public Library.

coll006,,0200.png,A Walk Through the Courthouse Square Historic District,,"City of Bloomington, Indiana",1888; 1891; 1907; 1919; 1921; 1922,"In 1818 the county agent was ordered to lay out a public square 276 feet on each side with streets 82 1/2 feet wide. The original town stretched four blocks east and west of the square and two blocks north and south. Streets immediately surrounding the square were then named, quite logically, West Main (now College), East Main (Walnut), North Main (Sixth), and South Main (Kirkwood). Laid out in what is now known as the “Shelbyville Plan,” cross streets intersect at the corners of the square. A small log structure was the first of three courthouses built in the center of the square; the final and present courthouse has been standing since 1907. The lots surrounding the square were sold at public auction on June 22, 1818. By the following January, thirty families had taken up residence and established stores, taverns, and industries.

Early businesses supported only the local agricultural and daily needs of the community. The Seward Foundry, an early blacksmith shop that started in 1822 at 7 and Walnut, continued operation until the 1980°s. Austin Seward is known for creating the fish weathervane that has topped every courthouse since 1826. Tanneries, lumber, woolen and grist mills, and distilleries were other early businesses. As stagecoach routes, canals, rail lines and highways were established through the years, industries flourished and markets expanded as trade possibilities to and from Bloomington increased. The Showers Brothers Furniture Factory was originally founded on the eastside of the square as a coffin and bedstead manufacturer in 1856. By 1912 it had grown into the largest furniture factory in the world, relocating to a new building at 8"" and Morton Street now reused as City Hall. Wick’s Bee Hive, a department store operating from 1891 to1976, took up various posts along the North side of the square during its long existence. Faris’ Market, started in 1923 and located on North Walnut, is the only store left from a time when grocers, meat markets, bakeries, five-and-dimes. department stores, and other commercial services lined the square to supply local residents.

Many hotels also opened in the downtown area with construction of a new passenger rail station on Gentry Street. Although now reused, the Bundy European Hotel and the Faulkner Hotel still stand, along with the grandest of them, the Graham. Through the years downtown became a center for entertainment with festivities revolving around rough saloons, Masonic ceremonies, restaurants, plays or recitations in various auditoriums. and eventually, movie theatres. The tradition continues today with many live music venues, bars. restaurants, specialty shops, and annual events creating the public downtown experience.

In 1984, the Commission for Bloomington Downtown (now Downtown Bloomington Commission) was incorporated with the mission to revitalize downtown. Its highest priority was “preservation of the integrity and uniqueness of the square. one of the few substantially unaltered, turn-of-the-century squares remaining in Indiana.” In 1986, the Commission became a certified National Main Street organization and the city a graduate partner in the Indiana Main Street program. Incorporating the Main Street program’s four-point approach of organization. promotion, design, and economic restructuring, revitalization conferences were held, similar programs in other cities were examined, zoning was modified to encourage downtown housing, and a director was hired. Local funding initiative programs for revitalization and restoration were also established including Curb and Sidewalk, Street Tree, Downtown Loan, Fagade Design, and Tax Abatement. Over $40 million in public and private investments were made in downtown as the city’s historic buildings were restored, reused and redeveloped.

One of the earliest local tax abatement projects involved the Graham Hotel, redeveloped as office space in 1984 by CFC, Inc. Federal historic tax credit projects redeveloped the Fee. Sudbury and Wicks Buildings, Vance Music Building, Howe Building, Hare Motors Sales Co. Building, Allen Building, the Knights of Pythias Building, and the Princess and Buskirk-Chumley/ Indiana Theaters. The largest single project.-again taken on by CFC, Inc., was reuse of all buildings on the south side of the square facing Kirkwood Street. As the buildings were found unstable. the facades were retained while the interior structures were rebuilt as one unit. Now a collection of shops and offices in a mall format, the building is collectively called Fountain Square Mall.

The Courthouse Square Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in December 1990. Four buildings within the district are individually listed on the National Register—the courthouse, the Princess Theatre, the Wicks Building, and the old City Hall. More information on the Courthouse Square and a copy of the National Register nomination is available in the Indiana Room of the Monroe County Public Library.

coll011,,1000.png,A Walk Through the McDoel Gardens Neighborhood,,"City of Bloomington, Indiana",1830; 1926; 1927,"As other Bloomington neighborhoods were developing during the mid to late 1800's, the area now known as McDoel Gardens consisted primarily of farms dissected by the Dixie Highwav(Rogers Street). The Louisville, New Albany and Chicago Railroad formed the eastern boundary and the Illinois Central Railroad spur created the current western boundary (Patterson Street). The Morton Dodd’s family farm was on the southern end of the neighborhood. By 1909, when the railroads assumed the name of the Monon Route, a handful of individual homes consisting of around 30 families, were generally located along First, Morton and Rogers Streets.

The Gentry family farm made up the core area of the current neighborhood. It centered around a large brick home on Rogers Street. When Henry B. Gentry’s Dog and Pony Show became a hit, the act evolved into the Gentry Brother’s Famous Shows. By 1902, the big top circus, which wintered here, was traveling the country in 72 railroad cars. When H.B. Gentry sold his circus in 1916, he was considered by many to be the greatest circus man in America. He died in Bloomington in 1940.

With the coming of the 20"" century, the neighborhood began to change dramatically as both industry and housing int ed. Limestone mills were established in close proximity to the railroad, eventually totaling eleven mills within three blocks of the modem boundaries of McDoel Gardens. The opening of Henley Stone Company Mill in 1893 was followed by, among others, Bloomington Cut Stone Company Mill (1906); Hoadley Stone Company Mill (1906) built by John W. Hoadley Jr. and, Radley Mill (1907) built by Bloomington-Bedford Stone Company.

During this same time period, the railroad company developed the rail yard just outside the modem southeast boundary of the neighborhood. The Monon switchyard created another source of employment in the neighborhood. In 1910, it was officially named for W. H. McDoel, the influential president of the company from 1899-1909. Improvements at the McDoel Yard, which doubled its capacity, included construction of a new turntable, roundhouse, and coal and water stations. The 1891 Dodds Subdivision, located between Madison and Rogers Streets, developed with the most prevalent house type of the time, the gabled-ell with either a cross gabled or pyramidal roof shape. Stylistic flourishes were discretionary—some reflected the Queen Anne, Free Classic or Craftsman styles, while others were plain in appearance. The Monon Hotel on South Street (Hillside Drive) also provided accommodations for both railroad employees and travelers.

Another significant event in the development of McDoel Gardens took place in 1919 when Showers Brother’s Company purchased 70 acres of the Dodds farm for construction of its new kitchen cabinet factory. The company, headquartered near downtown Bloomington on Morton Street, was at the time the largest furniture manufacturer in the nation. By the late 20’s a new manufactured item, the radio, came on the scene and the factory became known as Shower’s Radio and Cabinet Factory.

The demand for nearby housing prompted the platting of the Gentry farm into the Dixie Highway Addition in 1923. Over the next decade more than 80 homes were built or moved between Dixie (originally Park Street) and what is now Patterson. Thus the majority of houses in the neighborhood date from this era.

Catalogues homes—particularly popular in the Midwest—supplied a rapidly growing population with affordable housing. In McDoel Gardens, closely spaced lots (48” wide) with deep back yards and minimal setbacks created uniform streets of simple period homes. Predominantly bungalows, the houses create a distinctive rhythm to the street characteristically linked by continuous limestone walls. Exteriors typically exhibit small Arts and Crafts details with a few displaying Colonial Revival and Dutch Colonial influences. Today identification of such homes is not an exact science. Buyers were able to order their home with changes to floor plans, roof lines, porch layouts and decorative details.

The limestone mills began closing in the 1930s. However, in 1940 the Shower’s Radio and Cabinet Factory was taken over by Radio Corporation of America. Here the first “Nipper” model radio was assembled and within six months 300,000 more had been completed. The first color television rolled off the assembly line in 1954, paving the way for the plant to become world renowned for its production of color TV’s. For the next four decades, the RCA factory anchored the southern end of the neighborhood. Likewise, Bloomington Hospital, founded in 1905 on the north end, continued to grow and expand. Few new houses were constructed in McDoel Gardens following World War II and most of the neighborhood businesses closed. Then with decline of the railroads, economic downturns, shifts in work patterns, and the rise of the global economy, RCA eventually closed. The factory buildings were demolished in 2002 to make way for new development.

In March 2001, the McDoel Gardens Neighborhood Association worked to have a Conservation District ordinance passed. It governs only the demolition, new construction and moving of primary buildings to help slow the rate of housing loss to adjacent commercial and institutional development while allowing maximum freedom to homeowners. The association works continually toward improvements to the visual and physical characteristics of the neighborhood while preserving its history. Today McDoel Gardens is once again thriving as it attracts new homeowners and businesses.

coll016,,0300.png,A Walk Through the North Washington Neighborhood,,"City of Bloomington, Indiana",1890; 1898; 1900; 1913,"At the turn of the century, Bloomington boasted a small but growing university, a healthy limestone industry, and most importantly, the Showers Brothers Furniture Factory (“the world’s largest”)—which produced catalogue furniture for the nation. In the 1890s the Showers brothers had matured enough as business men to enter real estate speculation. They partnered to develop a two-block area adjacent to their Walnut Street homes as a residential district for their families and friends. Although the land was platted in 1889 by the Bollman family, the Showers family built or owned at least thirteen of the homes. Unfortunately, the original Walnut Street homes of the Showers brothers, James N. and William S. are lost. In contrast, the area developed along Washington Street itself remains relatively protected from commercial encroachment.

Showers family history begins in Bloomington in 1856, when Charles Showers began his furniture-making career. With his partner, James Hendrix, he opened a bedstead and chair shop on the east side of the square in 1862. Later, the successful Showers family also developed land and members are responsible for several subdivisions in Prospect Hill as well as purchases in the Bollman Addition which became the North Washington Street Historic District. From 1878-1884 the furniture factory was located on the east side of town at Ninth and Grant Streets. A devastating fire forced the relocation of the business to Eighth and Morton. This move, as well as the decision of Indiana University to move from Seminary Square to Dunn’s Woods after yet another tragic fire, created a market for high style homes on this side of town. In the early twentieth century the corridors along College and North Walnut were lined with gracious homes separated by boulevard-like medians. This vista is gone from the city forever, but remnants can be seen in the mature trees, walled gardens, stone steps and carved limestone railings on North Washington Street.

With the loss of so many early homes, Washington Street is the best remaining example of a neighborhood built for Bloomington’s entrepreneurial classes. The Buskirks, Grahams and Matthews, who were influential businessmen, and Nellie Showers Teter and Dr. Burton Myers, who were prominent names at the university, also lived there. An 1892 article in the Bloomington Telephone called this district the “Showers build- ing boom.” Interestingly, city directory research proves that this urban neighborhood also was home to chauffeurs and school teachers living among the Bloomington barons of industry.

The Queen Anne buildings erected by W.N. Showers and J.D. Showers, and the Eclectic and Classical Revival buildings erected by their children, remain a remarkable collection of residences in a neighborhood of great architectural integrity. While few buildings are identical, there is a repetition of elements such as porch columns, beveled corners, gable height, roof pitch and shingle and clapboard patterning, that give a visual rhythm and harmony to the streetscape. Two definite architectural styles predominate: Queen Anne with its complex massing, patterned framing and gable ornaments and the Free Classic style which mirrors the massing but recalls classical details through grouped Tuscan columns and pedimented gables. The Free Classic style was popularized by John Nichols, an early local architect and it has several excellent examples along the Washington Street.

“The Morgan House,” located at the corner of 10th and Walnut, is now believed to be patterned on the designs of George Barber and strongly resembles his catalogue’s House Plan #41. In 1981, this house became the first federally funded preservation project attempted by the fledgling local preservation organization, Bloomington Restorations, Inc. In significant disrepair throughout the 1970s and 80s, the house was adapted for commercial use and is the gold standard for residential restoration in our community. In addition to the aforementioned styles, there are also examples of a Colonial Revival style, an Italianate house and a Craftsman Bungalow.

The district also features houses designed by Bollenbacher and Lowe (528 N. Walnut) and John Nichols (418 N. Washington). By the mid-twentieth century these large homes were being converted into boarding houses for students. Years of hard use left their toll. In the early 1990s, a slow steady revitalization began, encouraged at first by a few resident owners, and then investor owners.

During a recent restoration of the house at 418 North Washington, the owner uncovered proof that the house was a Nichols design, and looking in the catalogue, could identify not only the house he owned but also an early image of the Seward property next door.

The caption reads, “If you want a cozy cottage with sleeping rooms above, here it is: hard wood floors and finish, brick mantel, cut glass: Basement under entire house. Hot water heat, first class plumbing. Prices complete $1900. ‘Eight rooms.’ Working plans and specifications $19.00.”

As in most historic houses, small modifications were made to the house over time. In this case the front steps were moved to the front of the house, although they were clearly according to the architect’s design when the house was built, as depicted above.

The struggle to maintain these grand houses continues. Recently the house at 430 North Washington, once owned by Wm. Edward Showers and later, William Graham, was converted into a bed and breakfast. It is hoped that this commercial use may help support the costs of repairing and restoring the house that so directly recalls Bloomington’s heyday as a major national furniture production center.

The North Washington Street Historic District was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in March 1991. The Morgan House is individually listed in the National Register. More information on North Washington Street, and a copy of the National Register nomination, is available in the Indiana Room of the Monroe County Public Library.

coll021,,0600.png,A Walk Through the Cottage Grove Historic District,,"City of Bloomington, Indiana",1860; 1890; 1905; 1926,"Cottage Grove Avenue runs through this district of turn-of-the-century, vernacular, wood frame cottages and 1920s Craftsman style masonry homes. The builders and residents of these homes belonged to all classes of early twentieth century Bloomington society. Tree-limed streets, some with brick or cut limestone sidewalks and cut limestone retaining walls, add to the historic character of the area.

The southwest quadrant of the area was platted by Daniel Read and others in 1853 as an addition to the city. The oldest houses in the district are located in a remaining segment of the Read Addistion along East tenth and were probably constructed between 1853 and the platting of the Cottage Grove Addition by Ira and Mary Batman in 1896.

The vernacular cottages found along Cottage Grove, North Lincoln, East Eleventh and East Twelfth were home to working class Bloomingtonians. Residents worked at the Showers Brothers Co. furniture factory, on the Monon railroad an at downtown shops, all located within blocks of this district. The Cottage grove Addition was expanded to the north in 1902 and again in 1903, ultimately bounded by Dunn, Tenth, Lincoln and the Illinois Central railroad on the north. Samuel Rhorer platted the Rhorer Subdivision along the west side of Lincoln between Cottage Grove and Eleventh in 1905. Most of the houses in this eastern half of the district were constructed by 1909. These frame cottages are vernacular in style with some Queen Anne and Classical Revival details.

Max Lade, and executive at the Showers Brothers Co., lived with his wife, Martha, in the former Hunter House at 644 North Walnut in the early 1920s. Bloomington architect John Nichols renovated the house for them in 1922, adding a large two-story classical porch. (The house was demolished in the mid-1970’s.) In 1923, the Lades platted a large addition, which encompasses most of the western half of the Cottage Grove district. The majority of houses in the Lades’ Addition were built of masonry in the Craftsman style between 1923 and 1929. Occupants of these brick and limestone houses over the years were professionals and businessmen involved in the limestone industry, local businesses, banking and medicine.

The Craftsman style, championed by the Atlantic coast designer and publisher Gustaf Stickley, was influenced by Medieval architecture and sought to celebrate the honest craftsmanship and basic structure of the home. Characteristic features are wide overhanging eaves with knee braces, exposed roof rafters and trusses, multi-paned upper window sash and pergolas. This versatile style was adapted in wood brick and limestone for bungalows, duplexes and apartment buildings. Sears, Roebuck & Co. offered many house plans and kits in this style, prolific in Bloomington in the 1920s. At least one Sears home was built in this neighborhood.

coll026,,0100.png,A Walk Through the West Side Historic District,,"City of Bloomington, Indiana",1850; 1898; 1900; 1913 ,"When Bloomington was laid out in 1818, the area now known as the West Side Historic District was undeveloped outlots—land reserved for small farming operations by town residents and for future urban expansion. In 1853, tracks for the Louisville, New Albany and Salem Railroad were laid along what is now Morton Street. Industrial growth centered around the railroad began with early businesses including Seward and Sons Foundry, Thomas Hardesty carding mill, McChum’s grist mill, and Major Hite’s steam
flour mill. During this period residential development was minimal, consisting mainly of 18 large tracts of land owned by prominent citizens. Federal, Greek Revival and Italianate styled I-houses were a predominant house type with excellent examples still present.

As the 19th century progressed the west side experienced increased growth. After a devastating fire in 1884, the Showers Brothers Company relocated from the east side of town to a site on the west side along the railroad tracks. The significant history of the West Side also reflects the migration of African Americans to the Westside of Bloomington where they were encouraged to purchase homes and to be close to the Showers factory, of one of the few companies that employed blacks. Other industries of that growth era were: Dolan Tierman Stave Factory, Field Glove, Bloomington Basket Company, Nurre  Mirror Company, Central Oolitic Stone Saw Mill, and Hoadley Stone Company. The area continued to be integrated, however it became familiar as the home of Bloomington’s go African American community and the location of its most important landmarks. Second Baptist Church, Bethel A.M.E. Church and the Banneker School are outstanding in both the quality of their design and materials. A few wealthy citizens and middle class businessmen built imposing homes along Kirkwood east of Maple, but this was not the residential trend. Instead, smaller lots were platted for denser neighborhoods on which simply designed vernacular houses were built for the West Side’s rapidly expanding workforce. Pyramidal roof, shot-gun, and gabled-ell house forms with Queen Anne or Free Classic detailing—often available through catalogs and pattern books—were common throughout the neighborhood during the turn of the century and many examples are still visible. The established nature of this community is also reflected in the landmark limestone buildings that remain.

Other buildings in the West Side reflect the city’s change from horse drawn to automobile transportation in the decade of the 1920’s. Car dealerships, garages, and motor specialty businesses were built close to downtown and reflect the industrial architecture of the period: brick construction with steel windows, stepped parapets and vaulted roofs. Residences of the early decades of the 20"" century also reflect the predominant types of the period, the bungalow and foursquare with Craftsman detailing.

The period from 1900-1918 is known as the “Bloomington Renaissance.” These years of growth and prosperity established the physical character of the city as it is seen today. Businesses of the West Side figured prominently in this era. Annually approximately $2 million in products and $3 million in limestone were exported, and $1 million came into the city through Indiana University. The heart of the West Side district was undoubtedly the Showers Brother’s Furniture Factory, the largest single furniture factory in the United States by 1912. Showers Brothers Company was also known for its unique scope of influence in furniture design and innovation, in its progressive stance on minority employment, and in the overall growth of the City of Bloomington.

During the 1990s, the West Side began experiencing a new type of growth. The restoration and reuse of large industrial buildings began with conversion of Showers Brother’s Plant #1 into elegant office space and City Hall. The residential area also experienced revitalization by various public and private entities. Funding for these projects came from a variety of sources including federal tax credits, local tax abatement, CDBG funds, private investment, and other local programs benefiting owners of historic homes. The result has been an increase in homeownership and revitalization of the neighborhood’s sense of community.

Today the Near West Side of Bloomington remains a racially diverse, family oriented neighborhood with minimal alterations to its historic homes and commercial buildings. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is the largest area so designated in the city. Fairview Historic District, the boundaries of which are within the West Side Historic District, is a Bloomington local Historic District. Buildings that are individually listed are noted by NR (National Register) and LD (Locally Designated) in the site list. More information on the West Side, and copies of the National Register nominations, are available in the Indiana Room of the Monroe County Public Library.

coll031,,0500.png,A Walk Through the Vinegar Hill Historic District,,"City of Bloomington, Indiana",1927; 1928; 1929; 1935; 1938,"The Indiana limestone industry began with the arrival of John Matthews, an English stonecutter, in the 1850s. His small surface quarry in Ellettsville grew and by 1873, John Matthews & Sons Steam Works had installed four gang saws—to cut stone into blocks— and the first channeling machine, a revolutionary method for quarrying and transporting cut stone. By 1907, there were seventeen limestone mills and quarries within the city limits of Bloomington, with many more located elsewhere in Monroe County.

The Matthews business and many like it flourished during the late 1800s, the product of several influences. Limestone was in demand for the rebuilding of Chicago following the fire of 1871. At the same time, many architects, such as Richard Morris Hunt, were commissioned to replicate the styles of old Europe—Greek Revival and Beaux Arts—and ordered Indiana limestone to build grand houses like “The Breakers” in Newport, RI; “The Biltmore” in Asheville, NC; and the Frick Mansion in New York City.

The limestone industry saw its greatest growth and prosperity between World War I and the Great Depression. Often quarry workers found prominence as they rose to the management of large companies, founded their own firms, or became known for their artistic skills.

Also during the late 1800s Indiana Seminary, founded in 1825, became Indiana University. It relocated to Dunn’s Woods, the heart of the current campus, and construction of numerous buildings was begun. Swain Hall was completed in 1910 and further expansion continued during the 1920s and 1930s with construction of Rawles Hall, Memorial Hall, Merrill Hall and Myers Hall. The predominantly Gothic Revival style of the Indiana University campus lent itself well to the use of limestone, with elaborate architectural and decorative carvings found throughout these earlier buildings.

The hill east of downtown Bloomington that was to become known as “Vinegar Hill” began as several out lots on which an orchard was located. But its close proximity to the growing university campus provided ideal residential development potential. Construction of Elm Heights School was completed in 1926, and that same year the first home in Vinegar Hill was also built. It was the smell of rotting fruit from the abandoned orchards that was to give the neighborhood its name.

The prominence of the neighborhood is reflected in those who built homes here. Dominant names in the limestone industry with residences on the summit of the hill included Irvin S. Matthews and Albert T. Hoadley, both from industry founding families, and Kenneth Cline and David Wylie, owners of Bloomington Limestone Company. Master stone carvers also built here, although further down the hill, and included Domenick Mazzullo, Joseph Anthony, and Chris and Harry Donato. Prominent Bloomington business owners who built here included John Humphreys, a car dealer; Glen Woodward, owner of Woodward Insurance Company; and W. Earl and Mabel Sullivan, owners of a men’s clothing store. Many significant Indiana University professors and researchers also lived in the neighborhood including Alfred C. Kinsey, director of the university’s Institute for Sex Research, now the Kinsey Institute; Nobel Prize winner Herman J. Muller; B. Winfred Merrill, founder and first dean of the IU School of Music; and, Henry Radford Hope, namesake of the IU School of Fine Arts.

The early architecture of Vinegar Hill reflects several period revivals, predominantly Tudor and Colonial Revival, with Greek Revival, French Provincial, Spanish Colonial, Italian Renaissance, and Art Deco also present. Many homes are highly decorated with carvings, sculpture and architectural yard features, usually designed or carved by the master stone carvers who built the residences. Another distinctive feature of the architecture reflects the growing popularity of the automobile— inclusion of a garage in most home designs. While some have detached rear garages, a relatively high number of homes have a garage tucked beneath the rear of the house. Not only did this prevent the front facade from being compromised, the garage structures often supported outdoor living spaces. This further emphasized use of the rear yards as an extension of the architecture.

While later periods of construction are present in Vinegar Hill, little visible change is evident in the neighborhood. The trees have matured but most of the homes look much as they did when constructed. And while the names of homeowners have changed, they continue to reflect the businesses and professional practices of Bloomington, or the Indiana University faculty and staff. The historic district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

coll036,,0800.png,A Walk Through the University Courts Historic District,,"City of Bloomington, Indiana",1913; 1915; 1917; 1927; 1931,"The four original subdivisions in University Courts Historic District were platted between 1910 and 1913 on land that formerly belonged to attorney and farmer Moses Dunn. The Dunn farm and property stood just east of the present neighborhood on the site of the Indiana University HPER building (the former Men’s Gym). In 1883, after the fire at Seminary Square, the university began to construct a new campus on the Dunn farmstead. This immediately enhanced the real estate potential of all the adjacent land. The development at University Courts sought to capitalize on the proximity of what is now called the “Old Crescent.” The original developers were Elvet and Cora Rhodes and the German American Trust Co. In 1913, the remainder of the land was sold to Thomas and Nettie Sare. Only the first three subdivisions are part of University Courts. The fourth subdivison is now a part of the Indiana University campus.

The comfortable, gracious homes in “The Courts” were built by developers, limestone men, and others whose fortunes were made in business and industry. Many were the homes of distinguished members of Indiana University’s academic community. The houses were constructed predominantly out of brick and limestone in the popular period revival styles of the day. Georgian, Spanish Colonial and Mission styles dominated in the 1920s and Colonial Revival in the 1930s. The influence of the Arts and Crafts movement is also evident throughout the district. The builders spared no expense in construction, selecting the very best materials and including every “modern convenience.” Slate and tile roofs were common. No fewer than 13 buildings were designed by noted Bloomington architect John L. Nichols. The district is characterized by a relatively high number of architect designed structures, reflecting both the affluence of its owners and the relatively greater number of practicing architects in the Bloomington market after 1920. University Courts can boast examples from at least six known architectural firms including Alfred Grindle, Edwin Doeppers, Burns & James, Merrit Harrison, Lowe and Bollenbacher, as well as Bloomington’s own John L. Nichols. Thomas Sare personally developed four houses, all of which were design by Nichols’ firm.

The Sigma Chi House, erected in 1906, is the only structure in the district that pre-dates platting of the area. It was the first building to be constructed by a fraternity for its own use_at Indiana University. Through the years, nine Greek Letter Societies were housed in University Courts. Most were originally designed as single-family homes and later adapted as Greek houses. Beginning in the 1960s, a number of residences were also converted for use as offices by Indiana University. Much of the renovation has respected the interior and exterior of these houses and has helped preserve the district’s historic character.

In University Courts, single family homes were interspersed harmoniously with duplexes and small apartment buildings. All were built at a comfortable residential scale. Several paired duplexes are located on corners. They were developed by families who also resided in the neighborhood. The wealth of architectural styles, rich variety of building materials, retain- ing walls, and Bloomington’s only remaining brick streets create a charming and unique environment, a synthesis of “town and gown.”

Besides the men and women whose homes are described as part of this walking tour, other early residents of “The Courts” include: Agnes Wells, Indiana University Dean of Women; William Rawles, Dean of the School of Commerce and Finance; Zora Clevenger, Indiana University Athletic Director; Joseph and Agnes Nurre, of the Nurre Mirror Plate Company; Chester and Ethel Tourner, of the Tourner Coal Company; Tunie Buskirk, widow of a prominent Bloomington lawyer; stone man Philip Kearny “P.K.” Buskirk; and Kenneth Williams, professor of mathematics and celebrated author of a five volume history of the Civil War, Lincoln Finds a General; among many others.

University Courts, a neighborhood originally built to capitalize on its proximity to the University, suffered several demographic changes starting in the 1960s. The area was further endangered by the 1944 Master Plan for campus expansion. Original owners, who were mainly university professors and prominent local businessmen, began to age and sell their long- time homes. Many properties were converted to rentals or departmental annexes for the University. The area that once housed distinguished professors found itself increasingly defenseless in the face of maintenance issues and the clash between student and resident occupants. The struggle to preserve University Courts continued over more than three decades. As early as 1982, correspondence from President Ryan at Indiana University and Sybyl Eakin of the Historic Building and District Study Committee show that the community was already concerned with the conditon of the brick streets. In response, a local ordinance was passed to insure ayeropcisis repair of Bloomington’s historic brick streets, which had been randomly patched with asphalt and cement.

The University Courts Historic District was nominated to the National Register of Historic Places in June 1992, but was not listed until December 2007, overcoming much opposition and controversy. The protracted effort to reconsider listing was spearheaded by long time residents Sandi Cole and Jeannine Butler, who locally designated their own property in 1998 in order to renew public interest in the area. In 2004, the Bloomington Historic Preservation Commission locally designated the brick streets that are so significant to the character and atmosphere of the neighborhood. These are the only surviving streets of their kind within the city limits. Soon after the designation, discussions with Jeannine Butler led to an incremental approach to street repair, initiated by City of Bloomington Department of Public Works. Approximately 100 square feet of repair or $10,000 worth of work are budgeted annually. A substantial repair is anticipated in 2013, funded by a federal grant that was first applied for in 1997. The story of University Courts is one of patience and persistence in the face of adversity. Today the properties are well maintained and a credit to both the University and property owners. More information on University Courts, and a copy of the National Register nomination, is available at the Indiana Room of the Monroe County Public Library.

coll041,,1300.png,A Walk Through Bloomington's Black History On The Near West Side,,"City of Bloomington, Indiana",1900; 1909; 1920; 1990,"Historical Overview

In the late 1800s most of Monroe County's African American population lived in settlements northwest of Bloomington including Chandlerville, Hensonburg, and The Woods. Within the city, African American life centered on an area called Buck Town, which surrounded the first Showers Brothers Furniture factory between Grant and Washington Streets.

After the first Showers Brothers factory burned, the company built a new complex that would later become Bloomington’s current City Hall. Unusual for factories of the time, the Showers Company began hiring African Americans and women in 1868, bringing growth to the city’s west side and attracting Black workers to the area. At its peak in the 1920s, the Showers Brothers Company produced more than 700,000 pieces of furniture a year, accounting for than half of the furniture made in the United States per company statements. The company bank provided home financing, helping increase home ownership in the community.

Around the turn of the century, the Near West Side became a thriving community where most of the Black residents owned their homes, and some owned their own businesses. The Black-owned businesses included barber shops, beauty salons, billiard rooms and inns, many of which were located near the levee which ran parallel to the railroad tracks for several blocks and down Morton Street. Black owned restaurants in the West Side included “Sweet Chop Smitty” on the corner of 8th and Elm and for a time the Second Baptist Church and Elks Lodge operated their own restaurants on site.

Following the Civil Rights Movement, opportunities opened up for better employment thanks in part to the efforts of Reverend Ernest Butler, pastor of Second Baptist Church. Rev. Butler called upon religious and political leaders including Rev. Joseph Morrison and Mayor Tomi Allison. Pioneers in public employment included a number of West Side residents such as James “Snooki” Hopkins who became Bloomington’s first Black fireman in 1965, and Charles Brown who was hired by the city in 1967 as the first Black police officer. LaVerta Terry, in 1963 became the first Black woman hired as a schoolteacher. In politics, Paul Swain became the first Black city councilman and served from 1992 to 1995. Bloomington slowly began to change from 1960s through 1990s with the pressure and insistence of citizens black and white to include and recognize the diversity. The West Side’s Black community flourished through the 1970s but began to fade as broader opportunities appeared, and the local culture of lodges, clubs, and social organizations began to dissolve due to gentrification. This small community of African Americans who raised their children and worked hard to provide a living for themselves and their families in Bloomington remain a testament to this community’s achievement in the face of significant obstacles. This legacy is part of Bloomington’s shared history.

Notable People

Historically, the Near West Side has been home to many prominent members of Bloomington’s Black community. Mattie Jacobs Fuller was one such person. Mattie became a wealthy woman working as a beautician for the elite white women in Bloomington. Mattie Fuller used her musical talents of playing the organ and singing to raise over $12,000 and purchased the lot and paid for the foundation of Bethel AME church that was built on the corner of 7th and Rogers.

Another prominent Black citizen was Preston Emmanuel Eagleson. He was the first Black man to earn a Master’s Degree at Indiana University. The Eagleson family was once known for having more degrees than any other Black family in Bloomington. Preston Emmanuel Eagleson earned his AB 1896; MA 1906, Wilson Vashon Eagleson BS 1922; MS in chemistry, and Elizabeth Eagleson Bridgwaters AB 1930, just to name a few.

The Chandler family first migrated to Orange County from North Carolina and lived in the Lick Creek Settlement, before moving to Monroe County. Lick Creek flourished from about 1833 until the end of the Civil War. This community created economic, and legal independence offering protection from racial animosity, racist laws and fugitive slave catchers. The Bloomington Chandlers contributed to the City’s early jazz scene.

One other notable person in the Black community was Wilbur Miller. He was a WW II veteran, graduated from Indiana University in Physical Education, but couldn’t get employment in his field. He started physical education classes in the basement of Bethel AME Church. In 1951, segregated schools were ruled unconstitutional, Banneker became the West Side Community Center. Bloomington’s Park and Recreation Department hired Miller to be the first Director of the West Side Community Center.

Mrs. Maude Thomas boarded Black students from Indiana University when segregation and cost limited their housing options. Thomas operated three boarding houses for IU’s Black students, including her own home. In the early 20th century, it was unusual for a Black woman to own multiple properties. Thomas maintained a good relationship with many of her tenants, some of whom returned to visit her years later. Some of those students came up from the South wanting to further their education, and have fond memories of living at the Thomas home. Lehman Adams, an Indiana University professor of Oral Surgery and one of the first African Americans to enroll in IU’s School of Dentistry, remembers being directed to Mrs. Thomas as a student in the 1940s because he heard that it was a place he could stay while he finished his degree. Maude Thomas was said to be a soft-spoken woman whose life centered around Second Baptist Church, where she was an organist and a member of two social groups for black women, the Happy Hour, and the Jolly Bachelor Girls clubs.

He set up a ring in the backyard of the family’s 8th St. home. The Kid Williams Boxing Club produced three Golden Gloves champions and its boxers fought regularly in Crane, Indiana, against young soldiers, sailors and Marines.

Henry Hammond was born June 19, 1895 in Louisville, Kentucky to Charles and Mary Matilda (Brown) Hammond. He came to Bloomington by train as a teenager and worked at the Showers Brothers Furniture Company and Hook’s Drugstores before being hired as a maintenance man, house manager and cook for two Indiana University fraternities. Hammond also worked as a bartender for private parties hosted by IU dignitaries, such as Herman B. Wells, chancellor of Indiana University. He was a member of First United Methodist Church, downtown Kiwanis Club, a Kentucky Colonel, and an honorary member of Sigma Pi fraternity. He also served on the board of directors at the Boys Club. This house belonged to the Hammond family for several generations. Henry Hammond, at an age when most people would have retired, became a bailiff in the Monroe County court under Superior Court Judge Donald A. Rogers, and served with him for almost twenty years. He
was also a jazz saxophonist, who had a band called “Seven Sticks of Dynamite.” The band played in Bloomington dance halls for over 20 years and toured the region from Mitchell to Martinsville. Indiana. Jazz thrived in those days, and Hammond played with the best, including Hoagy Carmichael. Hammond was quoted as saying, “Hoagy would come up with us on
stage and blow his horn, he was just a regular fellow.” Hammond received several awards from civic organizations, including the Book of Golden Deeds Award in 1983 for distinguished community service.

Elizabeth Eagleson Bridgwaters was born into the prominent Eagleson family in Bloomington and married Albert Lewis Bridgwaters Sr. Her father was Preston Emmanuel Eagleson, the first Black man to earn a master’s degree at Indiana University. Elizabeth was a mother of nine and the first Black person elected to the Monroe County Community School Corporation, serving from 1969 to 1977, and providing leadership as board president from 1972 to 1973. She initiated changes in the board's voting procedures, and promoted reading programs for the poor. Her love and devotion to the city of Bloomington’s West side fueled her many civic activities such as Bloomington’s Neighborhood Development program and assisting in the creation of the West Side Neighborhood Association. She served on the board of directors of the United Way, the Area 10 Council on Aging, the Advisory Board of the older American Center, and the local branch of the NAACP. She was instrumental in the establishment of the Aurora Alternative High School which met the needs of young people who did not adjust to the regular MCCSC programs. Bridgwaters continued her work in education through service in such organizations as the National Black Council of School Board members and the Indiana State Advisory Council for vocational education.

coll046,,1400.png,A Walk Through Bloomington's African American History,,"City of Bloomington, Indiana",1869; 1905; 1925 ,"Since its inception, the city of Bloomington has maintained a deeply rooted African American history. Two African Americans, William Cooley and Aaron Wallace, purchased lots in the November, 1818 land sale. Literally, it was the second such sale of parcels in the city’s short history. No more information is available about these families, but census data from the 1860’s through the 1880’s document that the city attracted many African Americans primarily from Virginia, North and South Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, and Kentucky in the first waves of migration to the north. Although the Indiana State Constitution of 1816 outlawed involuntary servitude and African American citizens were free to live and work anywhere in the state, there were still those born into slavery in the south who fled to the north and were returned for bounty.

Bloomington’s citizens were active participants in what has come to be known as the Underground Railroad, a conduit of escape organized by citizens who opposed slavery and assisted in hiding individuals fleeing to freedom in the North. The path of escape led from Walnut Ridge, south of Bloomington, to northern stops in Martinsville, Morgantown and Mooresville. In 1917, Henry Lester Smith, the son of an abolitionist, recounted his relative’s stories of these harrowing times. Bloomington was also the destination of a generation of Scotch Irish Presbyterians from South Carolina who belonged to the Covenanter Church and settled here in the first half of the nineteenth century. Their houses, the Faris and Smith homes on the southeast side, now are landmarks along the trail to freedom. The stories of Lester Smith also recount the heroics of a Mrs. Myrears an African American who lived on the west side of town. It was on the west side, in a house that still stands at the corner of 7th and Rogers, where the local Knights of the Golden Circle (southern sympathizers) purportedly met. Another prominent early resident, Robert Anderson, has a grave located in Covenanter Cemetery. Once an escaped slave, he chose to stay in Bloomington after emancipation. He joined the Presbyterian Church that supported his freedom and his heirs still reside on land near the cemetery at High and Hillside Streets.

After the Indiana legislature passed legislation in 1869, “colored” students were required to be educated in public schools. Prior to this, the Bloomington’s Center School had been integrated and “colored” students occupied the upper floor. In 1874, “colored” students first began to attend a segregated grade school in Bloomington, in the same Center School building on the south east corner of 6th and Washington. White students moved to the recently completed “Central School” on South College. In 1881, there were 54 students under the age of 21 at Center School. T.C. Johnson, an eminent educator was the last principal of the Center School and first principal of the Banneker School which replaced it. He later went on to teach at Crispus Attucks High School in Indianapolis, now a National Historic Landmark. Elementary education in Bloomington remained segregated until 1951. Three early African American churches were founded in Bloomington, two of which date from the 1870’s. In the early twentieth century the congregations prospered and built impressive architect-designed limestone edifices on the west side of town. Taylor Chapel, which remained on the east side, closed in the 1930’s. The city’s African American community shifted from the east side to the west after the Shower’s Brother’s Furniture Factory fire of 1884 and the relocation of the University to Dunn’s Woods from Seminary Square. An early urban neighborhood that was commonly called “Bucktown” was located in the area between Grant to Indiana and south of 10th Street to 8th Street. Many of the residents in this area rented. It was also where Hoagy Carmichael visited house parties near his childhood home and heard the indigenous jazz that proved so influential in his music. These lives, filled with hard work, play and  striving for the future, were a catalyst for creativity. George Shively, the left handed lead hitter for the Indianapolis ABC’s, lived in this neighborhood. Later, following an opportunity to purchase their own homes, many in the African American community settled into an area north of Kirkwood and west of College, occupied primarily by the working classes of Bloomington.

A second but parallel story is that of African Americans at Indiana University. Marcellus Neal was the first African American student to graduate from IU in 1895. Preston Eagleson, a Bloomington native, was the first to play football and baseball at IU, graduating in 1896. The Eagleson family moved from Orange County, Indiana to Mitchell and on to Bloomington in the early 1890’s. Preston Emmanuel Eagleson (AB 1896; MA 1906) was later the first of his race to receive a Master’s Degree at Indiana University. It is thought that more degrees were conferred upon the Eagleson family from Indiana University than any other African American family—20 degrees and 2 honorary degrees. Wilson Vashon Eagleson (BS 1922; MS 1926 in Chemistry) married Frances Marshall (AB 1919, English), the first African American female to graduate from IU. The Marcellus Neal-Frances Marshall Black Culture Center on IU’s campus is named for her. After rearing 9 children, Elizabeth Eagleson Bridgwaters (AB 1930) became a civic leader and was the first African American elected official in Monroe County. She served on the Monroe County School Board and was instrumental in the establishment of the Aurora Alternative High School.

The number of students continued to grow but were barred from university housing until 1947, when returning soldiers began to attend college on the GI Bill. A small enclave of private houses on the east and west sides opened up for boarders, along with an unofficial dining hall and several sorority and fraternity houses. In 1911, one of the first African American fraternities in the United States, Kappa Alpha Psi, was founded and incorporated on the IU campus by Elder Watson Diggs. Samuel Dargan, curator of the IU Law Library for 40 years, owned several properties near 8th and Lincoln where students resided. George Taliaferro lived in this neighborhood at May’s House with other student athletes in the 1940’s. Upon returning after his service in World War II, he worked with Herman B Wells, then president of the University, to integrate restaurants and theaters in Bloomington.

The small community of African Americans who raised their families in Bloomington made use of the opportunities provided by IU. Many sent their children to the university and many had to leave Bloomington to pursue professional careers. With dignity and patience, individuals like Reverend Ernest Butler, a civil rights activist who marched with Martin Luther King, and Elizabeth Bridgwaters, Bloomington’s first African American school board member, became part of the city’s political conscience. Others like Clarence Gilliam, a chemist by profession and long-time president of the NAACP, struggled to provide opportunities for advancement and a better quality of life. Three landmarks on the Westside, Second Baptist Church, Bethel A.M.E.Church, and the Banneker School, hold many stories and are monuments to Bloomington’s African American community which thrived through the 1960’s and faded as broader opportunities appeared and the local culture of lodges, clubs and social organizations began to dissolve. The legacy that remains is a testament to this community’s achievement in the face of significant obstacles.

When black students were refused service at local restaurants, Mays also served meals providing a kind of informal student union for that community. Mays is remembered fondly by athletes of the era before 1947 when the dorm system was finally opened to all students. George Taliaferro, famed Indiana University running back, stated that the small home held up to 16 people during this time, as many as four to a room. Along with Dargan House, the Elms, and the now demolished “Do DropIn” House this area of the east side was the focus of African American student life in the 20’s, 30’s and 40’s.",House,Carpenter-Builder ,,,residential architecture; vernacular architecture,"Bloomington, Indiana",39.16934971,-86.5288971,"Historic Bloomington Walking Tours, City of Bloomington--A Walk Through Bloomington's African American History",Image;StillImage,image/png,eng,

The Kappas also occupied properties at 417 East 9th Street and had their initial meetings at 527 East Kirkwood. Ultimately they purchased a permanent location.

He was called the “Dean of Bloomington Barbers” and was active in republican politics. In 1914 he purchased his own building just west of the square. He was the first African American to own a downtown building in Bloomington, one that initially housed the First National Bank. Many local families, including the Eaglesons, the Drakes and the Evans were originally in this business. Clientele were segregated because proprietors feared that their business might be affected. Herman B Wells integrated the student union barber shop in 1948 hiring John Plew as its first black barber.

coll050,coll046,1414.png,Blair House; 823 North Maple Street,No. 14,,1869,"One house on the west side illustrates Bloomington’s substantial history in the Underground Railroad. James Blair was among a group of families of Scotch Irish descent who moved from South Carolina to Bloomington in the early settlement years. They were members of the Presbyterian church holding strong abolitionist opinions. Called the Covenanters, many settled southeast of town, where their first church was built. The Smith’s, Faris’s and Blair’s were all believed to be activists in the Underground Railroad and harbored fugitive slaves in the years before the Civil War. Blair founded his farm northwest of town in a grove of maples. The house still stands on North Maple Street. A cemetery associated with the church stands at High and Hillside surrounded by dry laid limestone walls and ancient oak trees. Robert Anderson was hiding with the James Faris family when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed by Lincoln. He decided to stay as a free man and tended to church property, eventually becoming a member. Although there is a legend that the land was left to them, relatives say that land adjacent to the cemetery was purchased from the church, after the original brick building burned. Anderson, born into slavery in Kentucky in 1847, is buried here. Jared Jeffries, an NBA player born in Bloomington, is his great-great grandson. Relatives of Robert Anderson still make their homes on the land to the north.

coll051,,1100.png,A Walk Through the Showers Brothers Furniture Factory,,"City of Bloomington, Indiana",1906; 1910; 1915; 1923; 1995,"The site of Bloomington, Indiana’s City Hall was once home to the Showers Brothers Furniture Factory. At its peak in the 1920s, the Showers Brothers Company produced more than 700,000 pieces of furniture a year, enough to fill 16 train-car loads a day. Producing more than half of all the furniture made in the United States, the company declared itself “the world’s largest producer of bedroom and dining room furniture.” Showers Company expanded the market for its products by selling through the Sears Roebuck and Montgomery Ward catalogues. This was a very innovative marketing strategy for the day, allowing them much broader contact with potential customers than selling through local furniture stores.

Charles C. Showers, a cabinetmaker and part-time preacher, founded the Company in 1856 and later turned it over to his sons. The Company remained in the family for three generations. Showers Company was a major employer in Bloomington, with as many as 1,200 workers. It accounted for a quarter of the City’s tax revenues. The company was so important to the local economy that the City paid almost half the cost of a new factory on Morton Street after a fire destroyed its production facility on Grant Street. By 1910, the new plant occupied a seven-acre complex at its location on Morton Street.

As a family-run business, Showers was known for its liberal employee benefits and was exceptional in its hiring of women and African-Americans. The Showers brothers established a bank “solely for the benefit of its employees...” to both encourage and enable them to own their own homes. The brothers also sponsored a number of company events including professional performances in the auditorium (601 N. Morton), the Showers Brothers orchestra, basketball and baseball teams, and boxing leagues. The brothers provided employees with a company grocery store and a subsidized cafeteria. They were so highly regarded in the community that, when the eldest brother, James, died in 1913, business in Bloomington virtually stopped so that, “*...all classes of people could pay their last respects to this pioneer, industrial leader and banker who, during his life, gave such outstanding service to the community.”

Business declined during the Great Depression and then resurged briefly around World War II. In the 1940s, the furniture industry began moving to the south to take advantage of cheap labor. At the same time, the trucking industry emerged and became the preferred means for transporting goods. When the Showers Company did not make the necessary investments to switch from train to truck distribution of its products, the company could no longer compete. After a long and illustrious history, the Showers Company shut down in 1955. The Stork Line Furniture of Chicago bought the business and ran it for a few years. In 1959, the Morton Street factory was sold to Indiana University to be used for storage until 1994. Two fires in 1966 destroyed a large part of the remaining Showers complex including the north section of the existing facility.

Plant No. 1 was designed by Chicago engineer Charles H. Ballew and constructed in 1910 around the existing factory. It is the largest remaining historic industrial building in Bloomington, Indiana. The building is one of many industrial and commercial structures built near the original location of the Louisville, New Albany and Salem Railroad which ran north and south through the core of Bloomington. The red brick masonry walls, heavy timber frame construction, structural wood floor decking, double-leaf doors, wood frame and steel sash windows and sawtooth roof were functionally designed to accommodate the company’s manufacturing process. The building had to be substantial enough to support both heavy machinery and inventory. Windows and the sawtooth roof with clerestories provided the buildings only light until being electrified in 1896. The double leaf doors facilitated movement of goods. Today, Plant No. 1 is one of the few remaining buildings in the Showers complex which, at the height of production, covered 15 acres.

Historic industrial buildings usually possess solid construction, open floor plans and an abundance of natural light, features that make them adaptable to a variety of new and interesting uses. In 1994-1996 the City of Bloomington, CFC, Inc, a local developer and Indiana University joined forces to revitalize the industrial building. The City of Bloomington used the space for its new City Hall; CFC, Inc, for commercial offices; and Indiana University for a Research Park. The building was separated into three different sections for the three owners and then subdivided for office use. The historic rehabilitation was guided by the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation and maintained the building’s historic integrity. As one observer wrote, “...The factory represents a model of adaptive reuse and urban planning that seeks to reclaim and revitalize Bloomington’s downtown indus- trial sector and preserve the city’s historic identity and legacy.” The collaborative effort to revitalize the Showers building breathed new life into the city’s west side and sparked other rehabilitation projects in the area.

Showers Plaza, once the home of an industrial giant, is again bustling with activity and is a source of civic pride prompting the restoration project to be called “The Miracle on Morton Street.”

coll056,,0700.png,A Walk Through the North Indiana Avenue Historic District,,"City of Bloomington, Indiana",1890; 1901; 1905; 1907,"In 1857, Moses Dunn, an attorney and farmer, inherited a 160-acre tract of land that encompassed what is now the North Indiana Avenue Historic District. In 1873, he platted 63’ by 142’ lots in the Dunn Addition, a narrow strip of his land adjoining the eastern edge of the original plat of Bloomington. One year earlier, Jacob Young platted an addition to the city to the north of the original plat (replatted in 1927 by Fred and Hallie Prow as Prow’s Gardens), which bordered the Dunn Addition to the east. The area began to grow after Indiana University moved to its new location in Dunn Meadow in 1884 and the city expanded in this northeasterly direction. The Margaret McCalla School, the northern anchor of the district, was built in 1907 in response to this growth. The former Sigma Pi House (201 North Indiana) anchors the district on the south and exemplifies the district’s association with the university.

The district is characterized by cottages and larger houses in the Queen Anne, Free Classic and period revival styles. They were built and occupied by Bloomington business owners, professionals and Indiana University professors and employees. The period revival houses include Tudor, Colonial and Dutch Colonial Revival styles built in the 1920s and 1930s. Two Classical Revival style structures in the district, the McCalla School and a late nineteenth century house, were designed by Bloomington architect John Nichols. American styles of architecture are present in Craftsman style bungalows, American four-squares and a Prairie style house. Cut limestone retaining walls and brick sidewalks add to the historic character of the district.

Downtown Bloomington businesses owned and operated by residents of the district were Reed’s Steam Laundry, the Vermilya Pharmacy and the Wylie furniture store. Professionals in the neighborhood included a judge, a State Supreme Court chief justice, a politician, an engineer and Indiana University professors. An Indiana Limestone Company estimator, Showers Brothers furniture factory employees and other working class people also lived throughout the district. Indiana University Professor of Philosophy and Physiology Ernest Lindley, for whom Lindley Hall on the I.U. campus is names, lived with his wife, Elisabeth, at 515 East Eighth. Their house became the home of the Sigma Phi Upsilon and Sigma Delta Tau sororities in the 1930s. The district’s most famous resident was Hoagy Carmichael, who lived with his family for a time in a modest L-shaped house at 214 North Dunn.

coll061,,0900.png,A Walk Through the Monroe County Courthouse,,"City of Bloomington, Indiana",1910; 1978,"Monroe County was founded in January of 1818. That same year David Rogers conveyed his wheat field to the county for the purposes of laying out the public square of Bloomington. The original plat anticipated a courthouse placed in an open central square with major streets intersecting at each of the four-corners. Later known as the Shelbyville plan, it allowed the orientation of business buildings to face the governmental center of town. By August of 1818, a temporary log building was constructed at what is now 106 S. Walnut Street. It was later the location of jails built in 1870 and 1936. Known as a dogtrot, the building consisted of two rooms separated by an open passageway.

In 1819 the county began construction of a brick courthouse. Completed in 1826, the simple, two-story square building topped with a tower was sited in the center of the square per the original plan. Thirty years later, two wings and a four-columned porch were added. A clock tower was added in 1875 and the building was remodeled in the Mansard style.

Ground was broken in 1906 for the third and present courthouse. It was designed in the style of Beaux-Arts Classicism, by the Fort Wayne architectural firm of Wing and Mahurin, who also designed at least three other Indiana courthouses. The contractors were George W. Caldwell and Lester Drake of Columbus, Indiana, noted for their completion of both West Baden Hotel, West Baden, Indiana, and the Palace of Agriculture at the St. Louis World’s Fair. The building was dedicated in 1908.

In 1962 the interior was altered to provide additional work space, but by the mid-1970s the county found itself again in need. Many options were explored, including demolition, because the building was “not considered to be of any major historical significance.” A small group of local citizens began efforts to counteract this opinion. Their first step was to list the courthouse on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. A plaque located to the left of the south entrance commemorates this event. The “Save Our Courthouse Committee” of Bloomington Restorations, Inc. continued to push for restoration of the building. Despite this, the integrity of the historic courthouse was threatened by new proposals, including construction of east and west wings and underground additions as well as the desire to replace it with a new building. At long last, the County Commission approved emergency restoration of the dome, which seemed to be a first step. Still, talk returned to demolition. Not until 1983 was the long argument over and the courthouse finally approved for restoration. The building now houses the administrative offices of county government and a new Justice Building was constructed in 1986 at 7th Street and College Avenue for court procedures.

Today the courthouse serves as a tribute to the history and heritage of Monroe County’s citizens past and present. Its art, architecture and monuments demonstrate the pride Hoosiers have for their state. Its restoration exemplified that pride locally and was the beginning of a historic preservation ethic that began downtown and has now spread throughout the city and county. Welcome to the Monroe County Courthouse!

coll064,,1200.png,A Walk Through the Rose Hill Cemetary,,"City of Bloomington, Indiana",1912; 1981,"Monroe County, named for President James Monroe, was established following the Treaty of St. Mary’s Ohio, and in April 1818 the county seat of Bloomington was platted. Originally wooded hills, the centrally-located land on which the town was formed had already been converted over to farm fields by pioneers Robertson Graham and David Rogers. Along with construction of a court house, churches and similar establishments, the new town required a burial yard. In 1819 a site west of town was chosen by the County Commissioners. Called the Grave Yard, the site was so marked by a G.Y. carved into a large oak tree near the entrance. The County Board maintained the cemetery until 1868, when jurisdiction was passed to the City and it became known as City Cemetery. Now known as the ‘Old Spencer Addition,’ this original burial area is the most eastern section of the cemetery bordered by Fourth, Maple and Third Streets.

By the late 1800s, vandalism, recreational use and a lack of fulltime oversight had taken its toll on the cemetery. In 1892 the Ladies Cemetery Association, a civic group reporting to the City Council Cemetery Committee, formed “to improve and beautify the City Cemetery grounds.” These eight women began raising funds for improvements, including expansion into what is now referred to as the ‘Spencer Addition.’ They also changed the cemetery’s name to Rose Hill commemorating the many wild and cultivated roses growing throughout the grounds. Unfortunately at present, few rose bushes remain. By April 1893, a sexton’s cottage was constructed, allowing full-time oversight of the cemetery. A fountain, made locally by Seward Foundry also was installed in the center of Evergreen Arbor, a circular planting of pine trees near the center of the new section. After years of vandalism it was relocated to Third Street Park in 1991. The mature pines were some of the 12 lost during a spring storm in 2000, but were replaced soon after that. An 1894 benefit performance by Henry B. Gentry of Bloomington’s Gentry Brother’s Circus, funded construction of an elaborate Fourth Street entrance gate designed by the city’s first architect, John B. Nichols. Carved by James Voss using stone donated by several local quarries, the Gothic Revival-style gate had a central arch wide enough for vehicular traffic flanked on either side by smaller arched entrances for foot traffic. The existing entrance pillars, as depicted on the cover, were carved by Ned Cunningham.

Because no burial records were kept prior to 1897, all information before this date must be derived from newspaper articles, obituaries and the headstones. On those stones that are stil] readable, many names of the county’s earliest pioneers can be found. A few prominent figures associated with the early years of Indiana University buried in Old Spencer Addition include the Rev. Elisha Ballantine, professor of Greek; Theophilus A. Wylie, a professor of natural philosophy and chemistry; Daniel Kirkwood, professor of mathematics; and, Lewis Bollman, the first graduate of Indiana Seminary who received his degree in 1830. Five Revolutionary War soldiers are known to be buried at Rose Hill, along with many more veterans of the Civil War and all other wars fought by Americans through at least the Vietnam War. Additionally, at least 12 of Bloomington’s mayors are also buried here.

The cemetery was enlarged to the north and west between 1907 and 1927. A 1929 expansion to the east prompted removal of the original stone entrance, replaced with the current poured concrete and iron gate. Rose Hill Cemetery now encompasses 28 acres. Limestone walls along the north and west sides, and ditches throughout, were installed in 1936 as a Works Progress Administration project. Buried over time, the ditches were discovered and restored in 1993. A poured concrete wall replaced the limestone along Kirkwood Avenue in 2000. The existing limestone pillars at the cemetery entrance were carved by Ned Cunningham. Additional interesting features in Rose Hill include the infant burial section along the western boundary, and the many family plots defined by elaborate fencing, higher retaining walls or low walls with coping stones. These have been locally referred to as “pens.” Like- wise, headstone placements in the newer sections do not necessarily conform to a straight grid, but instead often follow the roadways.

In 1905, the Ladies Cemetery Association along with several other women’s service groups, incorporated as the Local Council of Women. Its first project was creation of Bloomington Hospital, and the group has continued to focus on health and human welfare needs since that time. In 1997 the City’s Parks and Recreation Department assumed administration and maintenance of the cemetery from the Public Works Department.

Throughout modern history headstones have been decorated with symbolic images, stylistically reflecting current historical and architectural trends, along with changing tastes and trends. Rose Hill Cemetery is an excellent example of this variety, displaying stones from its pioneer beginnings to the present day.

Popular during the Victorian era, these stones were both typically carved in limestone and could be ordered through Sears and Roebuck, making their prevalence in Rose Hill particularly significant. Some are tall and elaborate, others short and simple, and some are combined with Victorian-styled “soul houses.” Often adorned with other forms of symbolism, treestones themselves when depicted as a broken stump, refer to a life cut short. Treestones often were used for members of the Woodmen of the World, an insurance society, evidenced by the fraternal order’s symbol.

coll065,coll064,1209.png,"Margaret Hemphill McCalla, 1836-1912; Section A",No. 9,,1912,"Around 1835, Samuel McCalla brought his family to Monroe County's Salt Creek Township from the Chester District of upland South Carolina. Daughter Margaret Hemphill McCalla was born here in 1836, and after attending a one-room school, she graduated from the Monroe County Female Seminary. Following service as a one-room school teacher, McCalla began instructing at the Bloomington Graded School upon its 1863 establishment. By 1873, girls were admitted to the university and closer coordination of higher grades instruction with the university entrance requirements was desired. When Bloomington High School, one of the first in the state, was founded McCalla was closely involved in the process. It is now known as Bloomington High School South. McCalla first taught mathematics and was then elected to school superintendent from 1875-1877, the first woman in Indiana to hold this position. In 1908, the new Bloomington elementary school at Tenth Street and Indiana Avenue was named in her honor. Designed by John Nichols, the Classical Revival style building was closed in 1970 and now houses the Fine Arts department at Indiana University.",Tombstone,,,,graves,"Bloomington, Indiana",39.16612503,-86.54729822,"Historic Bloomington Walking Tours, City of Bloomington--A Walk Through the Rose Hill Cemetary",Image;StillImage,image/png,eng,
coll066,coll064,1213.png,"Hoagland (Hoagy) Howard Carmichael, 1899-1981; Section G",No. 13,,1981,"Despite studying law at IU, Carmichael's exposure to jazz musicians and cornet player Leon ""Bix"" Beiderbecke lit the fire that would become his life's course. His mother, who played piano at local movie houses, was his first musical inspiration. His own college band, The Carmichael Collegians, had some early success, but the band's 1927 recording of ""Stardust"" garnered little early attention. After briefly practicing law in Florida, Carmichael headed to New York City in 1929. There his 36 recordings for the Victor company included ""Georgia On My Mind,"" ""Rockin Chair"" and ""Lazy River."" In 1936, Carmichael moved to Hollywood and became a star performing on records, radio, stage and in movies. Three of the top four songs of 1946 were written by Carmichael. Together, he and famed lyricist Johnny Mercer won a 1951 Oscar for ""In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening."" Carmichael continued his television appearances during the 1950s, but much of his later music received little attention due to changing tastes. After his family donated Carmichael's archival collection to Indiana University, the Hoagy Carmichael Room was opened in 1986.",Tombstone,,,,graves,"Bloomington, Indiana",39.16520935,-86.54968659,"Historic Bloomington Walking Tours, City of Bloomington--A Walk Through the Rose Hill Cemetary",Image;StillImage,image/png,eng,
coll067,,1500.png,A Walk Through Bloomington's Women's History,,"City of Bloomington, Indiana",1848; 1869; 1922; 1947,"Since the time of Monroe County’s first settlers in the 1810s, women in the county have purchased property, ran businesses, and taken leadership roles in the Bloomington community.

In the 19th century, women cornered the student housing market by renting out homes and store-backs as boarding houses. Other women made their means as educators, either in public schools or later as Indiana University faculty, mostly in the English department. Still more women, mostly young and unmarried, took up jobs at the Showers Furniture Factory, which was run in part by feminist activist Maud Showers.

In the 20th century, a number of women’s groups were devoted to enfranchisement, temperance, business practice, and the construction and operation of Bloomington’s first hospital. Women also made up the vast majority of RCA Television’s employees. Their union went on strike on several occasions demanding fair employment practices.

Increased enrollment of women at Indiana University in the mid-20th century brought co-eds in conflict with IU policies including curfews and club membership. In the 60s, female students joined feminist, left-wing, and anti-war groups in large numbers, forming a prominent student political bloc. They organized protests and marches in reaction to both university and national issues. Their activities incurred the scrutiny of the FBI, which wiretapped womens health hot lines and gathered information on student activities. Meanwhile, the Kinsey Institute of Sex Research gathered information by other means for the advancement of the study of gender.

On a municipal level, women started to occupy more rolls in government. In 1962, the city council appointed Alice Dunlap as the second female mayor in the state. In the 1930s, school board member Elizabeth Bridgewaters had become the first African American elected to public office in Bloomington, and remained an active voice in the community for the rest of the century.

In the 1980s, Mayor Tomilea Allison instigated a grand project to revitalize Bloomington’s downtown. The area was widely considered unsalvageable, but Allison pushed to renovate the courthouse with aid from philanthropists Bill and Gayle Cook. Allison also committed her administration to the construction of some of Bloomington’s first bike lanes.

Today, the Bloomington community is serviced by the non-profit Middle Way House as well as a Planned Parenthood clinic. Women play a prominent role in both the university and the city, as groups and commissions continue to devote themselves to the rights and welfare of women in Bloomington, Indiana.
