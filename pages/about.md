## About this Collection

This is a digitized collection of tour sites from 15 self-guided walking tour brochures produced between 2002 and 2017 by the City of Bloomington Department of Housing and Neighborhood Development. All rights to these brochures belong to the City of Bloomington Department of Housing and Neighborhood Development. The brochures were created to generate interest in prevalent architecture forms and local history in Bloomington, Indiana. Links to pdfs of 13 of the brochures can be found on the City of Bloomington website: https://bloomington.in.gov/about/walking-tours. Physical copies can be found at the Monroe County History Center.  

Each brochure features a neighborhood or historic district in Bloomington and includes: a short history of the neighborhood/historic district/community; a numbered list of notable structures/sites in the area with the relative address, year of construction, short bio of the site, photograph of the site; and map of the neighborhood/district with number icons indicating where each structure is located. 

I created this digital collection for the class ILS-Z 652 Digital Libraries at Indiana University for the Masters of Library Science program in Fall 2025 with the aim to create a digital collection that be supplementary to the physical brochures. I set out to achieve the following:
•	Consolidate the brochures into one accessible database where browsing, sorting, and searching individual structures/sites is possible
•	Add additional descriptors for each structure/site (sourced from the City of Bloomington Interim Report, 2004)
•	Implement the individual structures/sites of each brochure into an interactive map. 

Below is an explanation of data elements I chose:

It is my hope that people who enjoy the physical brochures will be encouraged to learn more about Bloomington history and material culture when using this collection.
